# LaLigaPredictor

**Still in progress**

As of now, all data is in <i>data.csv</i>. Train with (N-10) samples, and predict outcome for last 10 samples.

Main program, <i>LaLigaPredictor.py</i> processes, cleans data and use a MLP classifier to decide outcome of unknown matches. We run the classifier several times to try different random-states, so we end up with a probability of each outcome (1, X, 2). If the probability of an outcome is larger than a threshold confidence value, we accept that result.

The goal is to offer the use a way to systematically predict the outcome of future matches. In betting sites such as https://sports.bwin.com/en/sports/football-4, a user could, under their own responsibility, place bets following the predicted results. A betting accuracy of 50% is our initial goal, as this means that one would always earn some amount of money.

### Data base

We generate the data base as a combination of:

i) Information about previous matches. Originally from https://www.laliga.com/, although info has been compiled in Wikipedia already (e.g. https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primera_Divisi%C3%B3n_de_Espa%C3%B1a_2018-19). It includes: Season, Round, TeamHome, Result, TeamAway, Stadium, Date, Time, Referee (only for 2016-2020), Spectators (only for 2016-2020), YellowCards (only for 2016-2020), RedCards (only for 2016-2020)

ii) Information aboutprevious matches and players. These info is generated by a crawler (see below). It includes: Season, Round, TeamHome, Result, TeamAway, Stadium, Date, Referee, PlayersRating, PlayersPotential

Combining these two data bases, we are able to generate a database with all matches from 2010 to 2019. The descriptors used so far are:
- Season
- Round
- Date
- Time
- TeamHome
- Result
- TeamAway
- Referee
- RatingHome
- RatingAway

### Crawler

We scrap basic match information and players from: https://www.bdfutbol.com

We scrap overall rating and potential from https://sofifa.com, which contains info about FIFA games
